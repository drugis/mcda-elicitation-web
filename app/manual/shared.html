<h3 id="mcda-overview-tab">Overview</h3>
<p>
  The foundation of a workspace is its data: the alternatives to compare, by
  which criteria to compare them, and which sources of data are used for each
  criterion, as well as any measurements that are known for each combination of
  data source, alternative and criterion. This information is shown in the
  overview tab, along with a description of the therapeutic context. See
  <a href="#mcda-benefit-risk-analysis">the theoretical section</a> of the
  manual for a more thorough explanation of the underlying concepts.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-workspace-download">Workspace download</h4>
<p>
  The overview tab lets you download a copy of the workspace (meaning the base
  data as described above, not any analytical problems, scenarios, settings or
  analyses that you might have created in the workspace) in .json format. This
  file can be sent to and loaded into ADDIS MCDA by others, or can be used as a
  basis for analysis in e.g. R.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-editing-customisation">Editing and customisation</h4>
<p>
  On the overview tab, you can edit all aspects of your workspace that are not
  directly involved in analysis (since this would lead to inconsistencies). This
  includes the names of alternatives, criteria and data sources, the order in
  which they appear in tables and figures and their references, strength of
  evidence and uncertainties where applicable. To change the order of elements
  in a list, use the up and down arrows on their left side.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-overview-criteria">Criteria, data sources, alternatives</h4>
<p>
  Criteria are what is used to compare the various alternatives in a
  benefit-risk analysis. They are presented in a list on the overview,
  optionally grouped into favorable and unfavorable categories. For each
  criterion, there can be one or more sources of data. These data sources supply
  measurements any number of alternatives, as well as a reference describing
  where the measurements originate, and an optional textual description of the
  data's strength of evidence and/or uncertainties.
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/criterion.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    A criterion with multiple data sources. Editing and reordering controls are
    outlined in red.
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Alternatives are the things that are compared according to the criteria. In a
  medical context these would be the treatments. They can be renamed and
  reordered just like criteria and data sources.
</p>

<h3 id="mcda-problems">Problem definition</h3>

<p>
  To be suitable for MCDA analysis in ADDIS MCDA, several requirements apply:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There must be valid data for each cell in the effects table, i.e. data for
    each combination of criterion and alternative. This means either an entered
    effect, or a distribution.
  </li>
  <li>There may only be one data source per criterion.</li>
  <li>
    Scale ranges must be defined for each criterion which encompass all the data
    for that criterion
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The 'Problem definition' tab lets you reduce your data set down to a useful
  and analysable effects table (which we refer to as a 'problem' for analysis)
  and define the scale ranges for each criterion. Here, you can switch between,
  edit, create, and delete problems.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/problemControls.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    The controls for switching between problems, editing their title, and
    creating and deleting them.
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  You can currently only edit the title of problems after they are created,
  since other modifications could invalidate any preference elicitation and/or
  analysis that has already been done for that problem.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-problem-creation">Creating a problem</h4>
<p>
  For effective MCDA a good effects table is essential. This means that only
  criteria that actually matter or have significant measured effects should be
  included, and there should not be 'double counting'. Double counting means
  measuring a single overarching criterion as two separate criteria, e.g.
  including both overall mortality and cardiac failure-based mortality as
  criteria. Doing so artificially inflates the importance of the double-counted
  criterion in the analysis.
</p>
<p>
  To create a new analysis problem, click the '+' icon in the problem controls.
  A dialog will open which shows the effects table, including checkboxes which
  let you select the alternatives, criteria and data sources to include. Once
  the problem is analysable, the dialog will also include a set of sliders below
  the table that you can use to set the scale range for each criterion. The
  width of a scale range for a criterion should be as large as you think makes
  sense given your expectations about the possible values for that criterion.
  Note however that making the scale range wider lessens the impact of the
  differences between measurements, since they will be a smaller portion of a
  larger scale range.
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/createProblem.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    Selecting criteria, data sources and alternatives to include in the analysis
    problem.
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  By default the scale ranges for each criterion are set to exactly contain the
  measurements in the effects table. You can make the scale range for a
  criterion wider than the default, but never narrower because then measurements
  would fall outside the scale range. By default a certain margin is made
  available on each side of the default scale range to extend it, and if this
  margin is insufficient, the arrows next to the slider let you extend the
  margins further.

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="mcda-preference-elicitation">Preferences</h3>

<p>
  For each <a href="#mcda-problems">MCDA analysis problem</a>, there can be one
  or more preference scenarios. These contain definitions for the partial value
  functions (see below) and any preferences about the criteria that may have
  been elicited.
</p>

<p id="mcda-scenarios">
  Note that it is possible to create multiple different scenarios with different
  preferences for each different defined problem. It is then easy to switch
  between these problems and scenarios in order to compare the model outcomes
  for the different cases.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-setting-pvfs">Partial value functions</h4>

<p>
  ADDIS MCDA uses partial value functions to determine how the 'value' of each
  criterion depends on its measurements. For example, overall mortality should
  go down, so lower values for this criterion should have higher value. Please
  see <a href="#mcda-mavt">the theoretical section on value functions</a> for
  more detail. A partial value function must be specified for each criterion
  before MCDA can proceed. Generally it is assumed that partial value functions
  are linear. This means meaning that e.g. going from 10 to 20 out of 100 people
  getting a headache is as bad as going from 80 to 90 percent. Specifying a
  linear partial value function for a criterion is as simple as clicking the
  button for that criterion that has the desired direction.
</p>

<p>
  In the case where value doesn't change at the same rate across different
  measurement values for a criterion, the partial value function is nonlinear.
  To specify such a function, click the 'Advanced' button below a criterion,
  select the 'Piece-wise linear' option on the subsequent screen and answer the
  questions asked by the system. See
  <a href="#mcda-theory-specifying-pvfs">The theoretical section</a> for a more
  detailed description of the underlying theory, with reference to the ADDIS
  MCDA interface.
</p>

  <div class="caption">
    Controls for setting the partial value functions for the criteria of a
    problem.
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Once the partial value functions are set, it is possible to determine how
  important each criterion is through preference elicitation. By default, each
  criterion is seen as equally important. The weights and importances are shown
  in the weights table below the partial value functions. Below this table are
  buttons which let you perform the supported methods of preference elicitation,
  as well as a button to let you reset the weights to neutral.

<h4 id="mcda-ranking-elicitation">Ranking elicitation</h4>
<p>
  During ranking elicitation, the user is asked to rank the criteria by
  importance, in descending order. The corresponding weights for
  <a href="#mcda-deterministic-analysis">deterministic analyis</a> are
  calculated to fit these constraints, with each less-important criterion
  receiving less weight than more important ones. Several things should be noted
  here. First, this method of elicitation preserves a lot of room for
  uncertainty. There are many concrete distributions of individual weights which
  still fit the ordering constraints. As such, ranking elicitation is one of the
  methods which lets
  <a href="#mcda-smaa"
    >Stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA)</a
  >
  take uncertainty in preferences into account. Second, since the weights must
  always sum up to one and are distributed over the criteria, including more
  criteria automatically makes the most important criterion
  <i>relatively</i> less important. You can verify this by comparing the weights
  table after ranking elicitaiton for problems with different numbers of
  criteria. This is something to keep in mind if you want to use ranking
  elicitation.

<h4 id="mcda-matching-elicitation">Matching elicitation</h4>

<p>
  Matching elicitation is a multi-step process that determines the trade-offs
  between a primary criterion and all other secondary ones. The user is first
  asked which criterion they judge as most important, after which they are
  presented with a series of questions, one per secondary criterion. Each
  question presents two alternative situations. The first ('alternative A') has
  the worst possible value, given the defined scale ranges, of the primary
  criterion, and the best possible value for the secondary criterion.
  Alternative B is the same but has the worst possible value for the seconday
  criterion (and therefore is by definition worse than alternative A). The user
  is asked to adjust the value of the most important criterion in alternative B
  so that each scenario is approximately equivalent. Note that there is no
  uncertainty in the elicited preferences.

<h4 id="mcda-precise-swing-elicitation">Precise swing weighting</h4>

<p>
  Precise swing weighting elicitation is an abstract method of preference
  elicitation that lets the user directly indicate how important they find each
  criterion's improvement to be. First, the user is asked which criterion is the
  most important to them. Then, they are presented with a table containing all
  criteria, including their worst and best values (given the defined scale
  ranges) and a slider that lets them indicate the importance of that criterion
  relative to the most important one. These importances are normalised to sum up
  to 1 to calculate the weights used in analysis. Note that are derived from
  these importances,
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/preciseSwingElicitation.png" />
  <div class="caption">

    one.
  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="mcda-imprecise-swing-elicitation">Imprecise swing weighting</h4>

<p>
  Imprecise swing weighting elicitation works like
  <a href="#mcda-precise-swing-elicitation">Precise swing weighting</a>, with
  one difference: in the second step, the user can specify the improtance of
  each secondary criterion using a two-valued slider, instead of having to pick
  a single value. These two values indicate the minimum and maximum weight a
  user is willing to assign to the criterion. This means that the weights are
  uncertain, which allows <a href="#mcda-smaa">SMAA</a> to operate on the
  preferences, besides any uncertainty that might be present in the data. Note
  that the uncertainty of imprecise swing is treated as a uniform distribution,
  meaning that each point in the specified range is treated as equally likely.

<h4 id="mcda-tradeoff-table">Trade off table</h4>

<p>
  For many users, it is helpful to illustrate the concrete consequences of the
  abstract weights which result from preference elicitation. The trade off table
  below the weights table does so by showing how much each secondary criterion
  should change to compensate for a certain change in a reference criterion. Any
  criterion can be chosen as the reference, and the values between which this
  reference criterion changes can also be set by the user.

<h3 id="mcda-deterministic-analysis">Deterministic benefit-risk analysis</h3>

<p>
  The deterministic analysis part of the ADDIS MCDA interface shows the
  consequences of a given preference scenario for each alternative's value. It
  is deterministic because in these analyses all uncertainty is disregarded: the
  estimated weights are used in case of uncertainty in the preferences, and the
  point estimates for each measured effect are used. This part of the interface
  also lets the user perform sensitivity analysis (i.e. check how strongly the
  value profile changes when the data and preferences are changed) in several
  ways. Finally, it is also possible to quickly switch between preference
  scenarios through the selector at the top of the page.
</p>
<p>
  The value profile plot shows for each alternative how 'valuable' it is given
  the available data and preferences. The value for an alternative is composed
  of its values for each individual criterion, multiplied by the weight of that
  criterion. So, if an alternative performs well on a given criterion but that
  criterion has a low weight, it can still contribute relatively little to the
  total value. The exact contribution of each criterion to the total value is
  shown in the bar for that alternative. When hovering the mouse over a bar a
  table is shown with the values for each criterion that it comprises.
</p>

<!-- FIXME: insert value plot fig -->

<h4 id="mcda-sensitivity-analysis">Sensitivity analysis</h4>

<p>
  Sensitivity analysis lets one explore how sensitive the benefit-risk balance
  of your analysis is to changes in either the data or the preferences. If
  changing a given point estimate or the weight given to a criterion by a small
  amount drastically alters which alternative is preferred, it decreases the
  likelihood of this conclusion being correct, or at least invites further
  scrutiny. If, on the other hand, a given alternative is preferred over the
  others for a wide range of different measurements and preference
  distributions, it increases one's confidence that this alternative really is
  'better.'
</p>

<h5 id="mcda-adjusting-measurements">Adjusting measurements</h5>
<p>
  It is possible (by clicking on them and adjusting a slider) to change the
  values in the measurements table. There are many possible reasons to want to
  do so, e.g. because you know that one study underreported certain incidences
  and you want to see how this might affect the benefit-risk balance. After
  adjusting one or more measurements, the 'Recalculate' button can be pressed to
  show a second value profile plot next to the first one, allowing easy
  comparison between the two cases and showing how the value of each alternative
  would change if the data were different.
</p>

<h5 id="mcda-one-way-sensitivity">One-way sensitivity analysis</h5>

<p>
  The one-way sensitivity section of the deterministic analysis can be used to
  visually inspect how changing a single aspect of a single criterion over the
  entire range of possible values affects how valuable the alternatives are. The
  plots show whether there are points where one alternative's value passes
  another's, and where they lie. This is another way of getting a feeling for
  how robust the recommendation of one alternative over another might be against
  possible difference in the preferences or data.

<h3 id="mcda-smaa">SMAA benefit-risk analysis</h3>

<p>
  <a href="#mcda-smaa-theory">SMAA</a> explores the possibility space (that is,
  the N-dimensional space with each alternative's measurements and weights as
  axes) defined by any uncertainty in both the data and the preferences for a
  given problem and scenario. For example, when a user has used ranking
  elicitation to define their preferences, and the data consists of point
  estimates with normally-distributed confidence intervals, there is uncertainty
  in both. SMAA will sample from these distributions while respecting any
  constraints (such as preserving the order indicated by ranking elicitation) to
  create a combination of exact preference weights and data values, and use the
  same process as on the
  <a href="#mcda-deterministic-analysis">deterministic</a> page to calculate the
  value of each alternative for this sampled situation. The set of values for
  each sampled combination, when taken as a whole, can be analysed to show in
  what fraction of the possibility space, for example, a given alternative
  outperforms all others (i.e. has rank 1 in the rank acceptability plot). For
  more detail, see the
  <a href="#mcda-smaa-theory">theoretical section on SMAA</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="mcda-smaa-uncertainty-settings">Uncertainty settings</h4>
<p>
  As stated above, SMAA explores the consequences of uncertainty, both in
  weights and measurements. The ADDIS MCDA interface lets you separately toggle
  whether to take the uncertainty in either of those aspects into account. After
  changing this setting, the 'Recalculate' button becomes available to
  recalculate the results and update the page.

<h2 id="mcda-benefit-risk-analysis">Benefit-risk analysis</h2>
<p>
  In a benefit-risk analysis, two or more alternatives are evaluated on multiple
  criteria in order to identify the best alternative, or to rank them from best
  to worst. Unless there is one alternative that performs best for all criteria,
  this requires decision makers to make value trade-offs among the performance
  levels for these criteria. This can be done in many different ways, ranging
  from completely informal to fully quantitative. ADDIS supports the latter.
</p>
<p>
  Quantitative benefit-risk analysis in ADDIS is based on a mathematical
  approach called SMAA, which combines
  <a href="#mcda-mavt">Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT)</a> to formally
  represent a decision maker's preference structure with stochastic simulation
  to handle uncertainty in the effect size estimates and incompleteness or
  imprecision in the provided preference statements.
</p>
<p>
  Although in reality a benefit-risk assessment usually includes more than two
  criteria, the underlying concepts are best explained in two dimensions, where
  the preference structures underlying the constructed preference models can
  still be presented graphically. Most of the discussion below will therefore be
  centered around a simple benefit-risk assessment problem in which there are
  only two criteria, as described in the following section.
</p>
<h3 id="mcda-running-example">Rimonabant example</h3>
<p>
  Although nowadays withdrawn from the market due to the high incidence of
  severe depression and suicidal thoughts in post-marketing surveillance
  studies, rimonabant was previously indicated as an adjunct to diet and
  exercise for the weight management of overweight and obese patients. For
  illustrative purposes, we turn back time a few years and consider the question
  of whether this medicinal product should also be granted marketing
  authorization for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The
  indication for which the benefit-risk assessment is conducted is the use of
  rimobanant as an add-on therapy to either metformin or sulphonylurea
  monotherapy, and the patient population consists of overweight or obese DM2
  patients who remained inadequately controlled after having been treated with
  either of these established first-line therapies for a period of at least 6
  months. The alternatives under consideration are rimonabant 5 mg/day,
  rimonabant 20 mg/day, and placebo, and the criteria based on which the
  assessment is conducted are the change in fasting plasma glucose (favourable
  effect) and the incidence in hypoglyceamia (unfavourable effect). The
  performance of the three treatments on these two criteria is summarized here:
</p>

<h3 id="mcda-mavt">Multi-attribute value theory</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of MAVT is to represent a decision maker's preferences for
  different medicinal products by means of a mathematical function \( v \) that
  associates with each alternative \( x \) a real number \( v(x) \) that
  indicates how the decision maker values this alternative relative to all the
  other alternatives. This function, which is constructed in such a way that
  alternatives with a higher value are preferred to alternatives with a lower
  value, is called a <i>value function</i>. For example, suppose that the
  decision maker's preferences for the three treatments considered in our case
  study can be described by means of the function \( v(x)=-10 \cdot x_{1} -
  x_{2} \), where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the levels of performance with
  respect to the change in fasting glucose and the incidence of hypoglyceamia,
  respectively. Using this function, placebo is given a value of \( -10 \cdot
  0.33 - 2 = -5.3 \), rimonabant 5 mg/day is given a value of \( -10 \cdot 0.30
  - 1 = -4 \), and rimonabant 20 mg/day is given a value of \( -10 \cdot (-0.64)
  - 5 = 1.4 \). As alternatives with a higher value are preferred to alternative
  with a lower value, we can conclude that, in the opinion of the decision
  maker, rimonabant 20 mg/day is the best alternative, rimonabant 5 mg/day the
  second best alternative, and placebo the worst alternative.
</p>
<p>
  As the above example illustrates, it is relatively straightforward to conduct
  a quantitative benefit-risk assessment once a value function has been
  specified. However, how do we know whether such a function exist, and, if so,
  whether is has a convenient algebraic shape that can be described in terms of
  only a few parameters? An answer to these two fundamental questions is
  provided in the next sections.
</p>
<h4 id="mcda-calculating-value">Calculating value</h4>
<p>
  The first step in a quantitative benefit-risk assessment is to explicitly
  define the scale ranges over which the decision maker will be asked to provide
  her preferences. Mathematically speaking, we can represent these scale ranges
  by means of the intervals \( [x^{\min}_{1},x^{\max}_{1}] \) and \(
  [x^{\min}_{2},x^{\max}_{2}] \), where the subscripts 1 and 2 are used to refer
  to the first and second criterion, respectively. One approach to setting these
  minimum and maximum values would be to derive them locally from the
  alternatives with the lowest and highest values on these criteria.
  Alternatively, one could construct a global scale by setting these minimum and
  maximum values equal to the lowest and highest conceivable values on these
  criteria.
</p>
<p>
  To make thinks more concrete, consider the rimonabant case study introduced in
  the previous section. For fasting glucose, we construct a local scale by
  setting \([x^{\min}_{1},x^{\max}_{1}]\) equal to \([-0.7,0.4]\), which are the
  to one digit rounded minimum and maximum values listed in the table. For
  hypoglyceamia, however, we consider the use of a global scale more appropriate
  as this allows us at a later stage of the analysis to perform an extensive
  sensitivity analysis with respect to the performance measurements on this
  criterion. We therefore set \([x^{\min}_{2},x^{\max}_{2}]\) equal to \([0\%,
  15\%]\), where 15% is the highest event rate that we expect to observe in
  post-authorization surveillance studies.
</p>
<p>
  At first glance, our decision to construct a local scale for the change in
  fasting glucose and a global scale for the incidence of hypoglyceamia may seem
  a bit arbitrary to some readers. It is therefore important to mention that the
  selection of the scale ranges only affects the region over which preferences
  are elicited from the decision maker and not the final results of the
  benefit-risk assessment. This is because for multi-attribute value models, a
  change in the scale range of one criterion would also result in a rescaling of
  the model parameters corresponding to the other scale ranges. For this type of
  model, the rank ordering of the alternatives is therefore not affected by the
  decision of whether to use a local or a global scale, provided that the
  parameters of the value function are adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  When combined, the two scale ranges form a 2-dimensional consequence space
  \(X\) as is illustrated for the rimonabant case study in the figure below.
  Some of the outcomes in \(X\) correspond to a real alternative (e.g., the
  outcome \(x^{\mathrm{plc}}=(0.33,3)\) corresponds to placebo), while the other
  outcomes correspond to hypothetical alternatives that serve to construct a
  quantitative model of the decision maker's preferences. To be able to proceed
  in such a formal manner, we have to make two basic assumptions. First, we have
  to assume that any two outcomes \(x^{1}\) and \(x^{2}\) in \(X\) are
  comparable in the sense that the decision maker either prefers \(x^{1}\) to
  \(x^{2}\), or prefers \(x^{2}\) to \(x^{1}\), or is indifferent between
  \(x^{1}\) and \(x^{2}\). Second, we have to assume that the above preference
  relations are transitive, meaning that if \(x^{1}\) is preferred to \(x^{2}\)
  and \(x^{2}\) is preferred to \(x^{3}\) then it must also hold that \(x^{1}\)
  is preferred to \(x^{3}\), and similarly for the indifference relation.
  Together, these two assumptions imply that it is possible to represent the
  decision maker's preference structure by means of a value function.
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/consSpaceRimonabant.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    2-dimensional consequence space obtained by combining the scale range
    defined for fasting glucose with the scale range defined for hypoglyceamia.
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  To illustrate how this might work, consider again the 2-dimensional
  consequence space defined for the rimonabant case study, which we have
  repeated in the figure below. We start the construction of the value function
  in the lower-right corner at \(x^{1}=(0.4,0)\), which can be seen as an
  extreme outcome in the sense that the change in fasting glucose is at its
  worst possible value while the incidence of hypoglyceamia is at its best
  possible value (note that for both criteria it holds that lower values are
  preferred to higher values). As the value of each outcome is expressed on an
  ordinal scale (i.e., a difference in value between any two outcomes does not
  have any meaning beyond the fact that the outcome with the higher value is
  preferred to the outcome with the lower value), we can arbitrarily scale the
  value function by setting \(v(x^{1})=10\). Next, we improve the performance on
  the benefit criterion by a small amount, say 0.2, and ask the decision maker
  to adjust the value of \(\delta\) so that he is indifferent between
  \((0.4,0)\) and \((0.2,\delta)\). Suppose that the decision maker states that
  at \((0.4,0)\) he is willing to accept a 3% increase in the incidence of
  hypoglyceamia for a 0.2 mmol/L improvement in the change in fasting glucose.
  We then know that the points \(x^{1}=(0.4,0)\) and \(x^{2}=(0.2,3)\) are
  equally desirable and should therefore be given the same value when evaluated
  with our value function. We thus proceed by setting \(v(x_{2})=v(x_{1})=10\).
  Continuing from \(x^{2}=(0.2,3)\), we again improve the performance on the
  benefit criterion by 0.2, and ask the decision maker to adjust the value of
  \(\delta\) so that he is indifferent between \((0.2,3)\) and \((0,\delta)\).
  Suppose that the decision maker replies by saying that \(\delta\) equals 2. We
  then have a third outcome \(x^{3}=(0,5)\) that according to the decision maker
  has the same value as either \(x^{1}=(0.4,0)\) or \(x^{2}=(0.2,3)\). In fact,
  we can obtain the <i>indifference curve</i> \(v(x)=10\) by connecting all
  outcomes in \(X\) that according to the decision maker are equally desirable
  to either \(x^{1}\), \(x^{2}\), or \(x^{3}\). For this, we continue the
  process of stepwise increasing the performance on the benefit criterion until
  we have reached the boundary of \(X\), at which stage we have collected enough
  information to fair in the indifference curve \(v(x)=10\) as illustrated here.
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/IndifferenceCurve10.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    Indifference curve connecting all the outcomes in \(X\) that according to
    the decision maker are equally desirable as \(x^{1}\). These outcomes have
    arbitrarily been assigned a value of 10.
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  When looking at this figure, we see that the outcome corresponding to placebo
  is positioned above the indifference curve \(v(x)=10\). Given that the
  preference direction on both criteria is decreasing, it must therefore hold
  that placebo lies on a lower indifference curve (in terms of value; not in
  terms of positioning on the graph), whose outcomes are all considered to be
  less desirable to those on the indifference curve \(v(x)=10\). Similarly, as
  the outcomes corresponding to rimonabant 5 mg/day and rimonabant 20 mg/day are
  both positioned below the indifference curve \(v(x)=10\), it must hold that
  both of these outcomes lie on a higher indifference curve, whose outcomes are
  all preferred to those on the indifference curve \(v(x)=10\). We can therefore
  conclude that placebo is the worst alternative, but we do not yet have
  elicited enough preference statements to determine the rank order the two
  remaining alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  To proceed with formalizing the decision maker's preference structure,
  consider the outcome \(x^{4}=(0,0)\) to the west of \(x^{1}=(0.4,0)\).
  Compared to \(x^{1}\), the outcome \(x^{4}\) performs better with respect to
  the change in fasting glucose while scoring the same with respect to the
  incidence of hypoglyceamia. Similar to the discussion above, it must therefore
  hold that \(x^{4}\) lies on a higher indifference curve than \(x^{1}\).
  Because value is measured on an ordinal scale, we can arbitrarily set
  \(v(x^{4})\) to any number larger than 10, say \(v(x^{4})=15\), after which we
  repeat the previously conducted questioning procedure to obtain the
  indifference curve \(v(x)=15\). By subsequently repeating this process for
  several outcomes in between \(x^{1}\) and \(x^{4}\), we ultimately end up with
  enough indifference curves to rank order all three alternatives (see figure).
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/IndifferenceCurves.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    Using indifference curves to represent the decision maker's preference

    alternative, and placebo the worst alternative.
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  The previously described questioning procedure is very general in the sense
  that it does not put any additional restrictions on the decision maker's
  preferences besides that they are complete and transitive. A downside of this
  approach is however that many questions need to be posed to just obtain a
  single indifference curve while multiple of these curves are generally
  required to be able to determine the rank order of the decision alternatives.
  A practical way forward is therefore to introduce additional assumptions about
  the decision maker's preferences so that his preference structure can be
  represented by means of a simple parametric function that consists of only a
  few parameters. In real-life applications of MAVT, this is usually achieved by
  assuming that the decision maker's preferences satisfy the conditions for
  applying the additive value model. This model is discussed in more detail in
  the next section.
</p>
<h4>The additive value model</h4>
<p>
  A value function is called <i>additive</i> when it has the following algebraic
  structure: \[ v(x) = w_{1} v_{1}(x_{1}) + w_{2} v_{2}(x_{2}), \] where
  \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) are partial value functions that reflect the relative
  desirability of different levels of achievement on the individual criteria,
  and \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\) are scaling constants that reflect how much more
  important the change from worst to best on criterion 1 is compared to the
  change from worst to best on criterion 2.
</p>
<h5 id="mcda-theory-specifying-pvfs">Specifying the partial value functions</h5>
<p>
  ADDIS uses bisection to specify the partial functions. To illustrate how this
  approach works, we use bisection to specify the partial value functions for
  the change in fasting glucose and the incidence of hypoglyceamia, which we
  denote by \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\), respectively. As the procedure needs to be
  repeated for each criterion, we start by specifying \(v_{1}\) and then proceed
  with specifying \(v_{2}\).
</p>
<p>
  The first step in applying the bisection method is to normalize the range of
  \(v_{1}\) by assigning a value of 0 to the worst possible outcome with respect
  to the change in fasting glucose and a value of 1 to the best possible outcome
  with respect to the change in fasting glucose. As the scale range defined for
  this criterion is \([-0.7,0.4]\) and the preference direction for this
  criterion is decreasing, this is achieved by setting \(v_{1}(0.4)=0\) and
  \(v_{1}(-0.7)=1\). Next, to determine the value associated with a third
  outcome with respect to the change in fasting glucose, we ask the decision
  maker to provide a value of \(\delta\) such that he is willing to accept the
  same increase in the incidence of hypoglyceamia for an improvement in the
  change in fasting glucose from \(0.4\) mmol/L to \(\delta\) mmol/L as for an
  improvement in the change in fasting glucose from \(\delta\) mmol/L to
  \(-0.7\) mmol/L. Suppose that the decision maker responds that these two
  improvements in the change in fasting glucose are equal in value when
  \(\delta=-0.3\). It then follows from the algebraic structure of the additive
  value function that it must hold that \[ w_{1} (v_{1}(-0.3)-v_{1}(0.4)) =
  w_{1} (v_{1}(-0.7)-v_{1}(-0.3)), \] which, after applying some basic algebraic
  manipulation, can be rewritten as \[ v_{1}(-0.3) = \frac{v_{1}(-0.7) +
  v_{1}(0.4)}{2}. \] Finally, given that \(v_{1}(-0.7)=1\) and \(v_{1}(0.4)=0\),
  we can conclude that \(v_{1}(-0.3)=0.5\). The value of \(\delta\) such that
  the decision maker considers an improvement in the change in fasting glucose
  from \(0.4\) mmol/L to \(\delta\) mmol/L to be equal in value to an
  improvement in the change in fasting glucose from \(\delta\) mmol/L to
  \(-0.7\) mmol/L is called the <i>midvalue point</i> of the interval
  \([-0.7,0.4]\).
</p>
<p>
  To determine the value associated with a fourth and fifth outcome with respect
  to the change in fasting glucose, we can repeat the above questioning
  procedure to determine the midvalue points of the intervals \([-0.7,-0.3]\)
  and \([-0.3,0.4]\), which, by following the same argument as above, must have
  a value of 0.75 and 0.25, respectively. For example, suppose that the decision
  maker considers an improvement in the change in fasting glucose from \(-0.3\)
  mmol/L to \(-0.55\) mmol/L to be equal in value to an improvement in the
  change in fasting glucose from \(-0.55\) mmol/L to \(-0.7\) mmol/L. We then
  know that the midvalue point of the interval \([-0.7,-0.3]\) is equal to
  -0.55, meaning that \(v_{1}(-0.55)=0.75\). Similarly, suppose that the
  midvalue point of the interval \([-0.3,0.4]\) is equal to 0, so that
  \(v_{1}(0)=0.25\).
</p>
<p>
  In total, we have now established the value of \(v_{1}\) for five different
  outcomes with respect to the change in fasting glucose. To further specify
  \(v_{1}\), we can either perform another round of bisection to determine the
  value associated with the midvalue points of the intervals \([-0.7,-0.55]\),
  \([-0.55,-0.3]\), \([-0.3,0]\), and \([0,0.4]\) or use a form of curve fitting
  to interpolate the value of all remaining outcomes from the value of the
  previously assessed outcomes. Here, we opt for the latter and complete the
  curve of \(v_{1}\) by drawing straight lines between the five data points for
  which the value of \(v_{1}\) was determined previously. The resulting
  piecewise linear partial value function for the change in fasting glucose is
  depicted below.
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/partialValueFunctions.png" />
  <div class="caption">
    Partial value functions for the change in fasting glucose and the incidence
    of hypoglyceamia.
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Now that we have completely specified \(v_{1}\), we can focus our attention on
  the specification of \(v_{2}\). The first step is again to normalize the range
  of \(v_{2}\) by assigning a value of 0 to the worst possible outcome with
  respect to the incidence of hypoglyceamia and a value of 1 to the best
  possible outcome with respect to the incidence of hypoglyceamia. This is
  achieved by setting \(v_{2}(15)=0\) and \(v_{2}(0)=1\). However, rather than
  proceeding with eliciting the midvalue point of the interval \([0,15]\), we
  take a shortcut by assuming that \(v_{2}\) is a straight line. The resulting
  linear partial value function for the incidence of hypoglyceamia is also
  depicted in the figure above.
</p>
<p>
  To get a better understanding of what the use of a linear partial value
  function implies for the decision maker's preferences, consider two
  arbitrarily selected outcomes \(x_{a}\) and \(x_{b}\) which are sorted in such
  a way that \(x_{b} > x_{a}\). Then, for the partial value function to be
  linear, it must hold that the midvalue point of the interval \([x_{a},x_{b}]\)
  is equal to \(\frac{x_{a} + x_{b}}{2}\). For example, for the incidence of
  hypoglyceamia, we can ask the decision maker to provide the midvalue point of
  the interval \([2,8]\). If he responds that this midvalue point is equal to 5,
  then his answer is concordant with the assumption of a linear partial value
  function.
</p>
<p>
  Both linear and piecewise linear partial value functions can by specified in
  the ADDIS benefit-risk analysis interface.
</p>
<h5>Specifying the scaling constants</h5>
<p>
  The scaling constants \(w_{1}\) and \(w_{2}\) indicate how much more important
  the swing from worst to best on the benefit criterion is compared to the swing
  from worst to best on the risk criterion. They can be obtained by applying a
  two-step procedure called swing weighting, which can again best be illustrated
  by means of an example.
</p>
<p>
  The first step in swing weighting is to obtain an ordinal ranking of \(w_{1}\)
  and \(w_{2}\). For the rimonant case study, this can be achieved by letting
  the decision maker choose between the following two hypothetical alternatives:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the outcome \(x^{1}=(-0.7,15)\) that performs best with respect to the
    benefit criterion but worst with respect to the risk criterion
  </li>
  <li>
    the outcome \(x^{2}=(0.4,0)\) that performs worst with respect to the
    benefit criterion but best with respect to the risk criterion
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Suppose that the decision maker responds that given these two outcomes he
  would prefer \(x^{1}\). From the definition of the value function, we then
  know that \(v(x^{1})>v(x^{2})\). For the additive value function, this
  therefore results in the following inequality: \[ w_{1} v_{1}(-0.7) + w_{2}
  v_{2}(15) > w_{1} v_{1}(0.4) + w_{2} v_{2}(0). \] Given that we have
  normalized the partial value functions in such a way that \(v_{1}(-0.7) =
  v_{2}(0) = 1\) and \(v_{1}(0.4) = v_{2}(15) = 0\), we can conclude that it
  must hold that \(w_{1}>w_{2}\).
</p>
<p>
  Now that we have obtained the ordinal ranking \( w_{1} > w_{2} \), we can
  proceed with the second step of the swing weighting procedure. For this, we
  ask the decision maker to give a value of \( \delta \) such that \[ (0.4,0)
  \sim (\delta,15). \] Suppose that the decision maker responds that
  \(\delta=-0.3\), so that he is indifferent between the outcomes \(x^{2}\) and
  \(x^{3}=(-0.3,15)\). This preference statement can then be translated into the
  following equality for the additive value function: \[ w_{1} v_{1}(-0.3) +
  w_{2} v_{2}(15) = w_{1} v_{1}(0.4) + w_{2} v_{2}(0). \] Finally, given that we
  have previously established that \(v_{1}(-0.3)=0.5\), \(v_{2}(15) = v_{1}(0.4)
  = 0\), and \(v_{2}(0)=1\), it now immediately follows that \[ w_{2} = 0.5
  w_{1}, \] thereby completing the swing weighting procedure.
</p>
<p>
  We can conclude that the decision maker considers an improvement in the change
  in fasting glucose from 0.4 mmol/L to -0.7 mmol/L to be twice as important as
  an improvement in the incidence of hypoglyceamia from 15% to 0%. To obtain
  concrete values of the scaling constants, we can therefore arbitrarily set
  \(w_{1}\) to a value that is twice as large as \(w_{2}\). Here, we opt to
  normalize the scaling constants such that \(w_{1} + w_{2} = 1\), which is
  achieved by setting \(w_{1}=0.67\) and \(w_{2}=0.33\).
</p>
<h5>
  Using the additive value function to rank order the decision alternatives
</h5>
<p>
  Now that we have fully specified all the different components of the additive
  value function, we can use this function to rank order the decision
  alternatives. In particular, it follows that the partial values associated
  with the change in fasting glucose and the incidence of hypoglyceamia are
  equal to 0.04 and 0.87 for placebo, 0.06 and 0.93 for rimonabant 5 mg/day, and
  0.90 and 0.67 for rimonabant 20 mg/day. When combined with the previously
  established values for the scaling constants, this results in a total value of
  \(0.67 \cdot 0.04 + 0.33 \cdot 0.87 = 0.31\) for placebo, a total value of
  \(0.67 \cdot 0.06 + 0.33 \cdot 0.93 = 0.35\) for rimonabant 5 mg/day, and a
  total value of \(0.67 \cdot 0.90 + 0.33 \cdot 0.67 = 0.82\) for rimonabant 20
  mg/day. Also the use of the additive value model therefore results in the
  conclusion that rimonabant 20 mg/day is the best alternative, rimonabant 5
  mg/day the second best alternative, and placebo the worst alternative.
</p>
<h3 id="mcda-n-dim">Generalizing to any dimension</h3>
<p>
  For didactic purposes, we have so far limited our discussion of MAVT to
  decision problems involving 2 criteria. However, when it comes to the
  benefit-risk assessment of medicinal products, there is a general need to be
  able to consider a larger number of criteria. Fortunately, the previously
  described additive value model generalizes easily to \(n\) dimensions: we
  simply extend the number of terms in the weighted sum formulation of the
  additive value function such that each criterion has its own partial value
  function and scaling constant. As the interpretation of the partial value
  functions and the scaling constants does not depend on the number of criteria,
  they can be elicited in exactly the same way as we described in the previous
  section. However, we do have to slightly extend the swing weighting procedure
  to account for the fact that there now are \(n\) instead of 2 scaling
  constants. How this can be achieved is illustrated in the case study conducted
  in the next chapter.
</p>

<h3 id="mcda-benefit-risk-balance">Benefit-risk balance</h3>
<p>
  Once the decision maker's value function has been completely specified, we can
  use it to assess the benefit-risk balance of regorafenib in a formal manner.
  For example, we can read from the effects table that the incidence of
  hand-foot skin reaction is 16.6% for regorafenib and 0.4% for placebo.
  Compared to placebo, the use of regorafenib therefore results in a loss of
  value of \(w_{2}v_{2}(16.6) - w_{2}v_{2}(0.4) = 0.084 \cdot 0.17 - 0.084 \cdot
  0.98 = -0.068\) for hand-foot skin reaction. Similarly, if follows that the
  loss of value is -0.023 for hypertension and -0.05 for haemorrhage. When
  added, the total loss of value associated with regorafenib's unfavourable
  effects is equal to -0.141. The median overall survival time is 6.44 months
  for regorafenib and 4.96 months for placebo. Compared to placebo, the use of
  regorafenib therefore results in a gain in value of \(w_{1}v_{1}(6.44) -
  w_{1}v_{1}(4.96) = 0.672 \cdot 0.698 - 0.672 \cdot 0.3 = 0.268\) for overall
  survival. As the gain in value associated with overall survival is sufficient
  to compensate for the loss of value associated with the treatment's
  unfavourable effects, we conclude that the benefit-risk balance of regorafenib
  is positive.

<p>
  SMAA-2 considers a discrete multicriteria decision problem consisting of a set
  of \(m\) alternatives that are evaluated in terms of \(n\) criteria. The
  vector of criteria measurements corresponding to alternative \(i\) is denoted
  by \(\xi^i = (\xi_1^i, ..., \xi_n^i)\), where \(xi^i_k\) is a random variable
  representing the performance of alternative \(i\) on criterion \(k\), modeled
  using some density function. For each criterion, a partial value function
  \(\nu_k (\xi_k^i)\) is defined to normalize the criteria measurements so that
  they are represented by values between 0 (the worst value) and 1 (the best
  value). The overall value function is then defined as a weighted additive
  combination of the partial value functions: \[ \nu(\xi^i, w) = \sum_{k-i}^{n}
  w_k \cdot \nu_k(\xi_k^i),\] where \(\nu(\xi^i, w) > \nu(\xi^j, w)\) implies
  that alternative \(i\) is preferred to alternative \(j\) given the weight
  vector \(w\). The weights define the relative importances of the scale swings
  (changes from the worst to the best criterion values), and \(w_k > w_l\)
  implies that if the decision maker would have to choose between improving
  either criterion \(k\) or criterion \(l\) from the worst to the best value, he
  or she would increase the performance on criterion \(k\) . The decision
  maker's preferences may be unknown or partially known, and therefore the
  weights \(w\) are also represented by a probability density. A total lack of
  preference information is represented by a uniform distribution in the
  feasible weight space. Partial information, such as importance ranking of the
  criteria, can easily be included by restricting the feasible weight space
  accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  For given (exact) values of \(x\) and \(w\) , the rank of each alternative is
  defined as an integer from the best rank (1) to the worst rank (\(m\)) by
  means of a ranking function rank(\(i, \xi, w)\). The main decision aiding
  measure is the rank acceptability index , denoted by \(b^r_i\). It describes
  the share of all possible values of the weight vector \(w\) and criteria
  measurements \(x\) for which rank(\(i, \xi, w) = r\). For example, \(b^5_2 =
  0.3\) means alternative 2 has fifth rank acceptability 0.3. The preferred
  (best) alternatives are those with high acceptabilities for the best ranks.
